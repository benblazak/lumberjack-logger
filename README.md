# lumberjack-logger
Log to rolling files from stdin

A small command line wrapper around https://github.com/natefinch/lumberjack.

Similar to [multilog](https://cr.yp.to/daemontools/multilog.html), except with a different (more human readable) filename format among other things; [pipe-logger](https://crates.io/crates/pipe-logger) except that it doesn't ignore pre-existing logs; and many [other tools](https://superuser.com/a/291397).
